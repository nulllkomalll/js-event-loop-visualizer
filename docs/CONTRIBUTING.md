## Branching Strategy

```
main                    ← production, always deployable
├── feat/short-name     ← new features
├── fix/short-name      ← bug fixes
├── docs/short-name     ← documentation only
├── refactor/short-name ← refactors with no behaviour change
└── chore/short-name    ← tooling, deps, CI
```

Always branch from the latest `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
```

---

## Commit Message Convention

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

```
<type>(optional scope): <short summary in present tense>

[optional body]

[optional footer: Closes #123]
```

**Types:**

| Type | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `feat` | A new feature visible to users |
| `fix` | A bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation changes only |
| `style` | Formatting, whitespace (no logic change) |
| `refactor` | Code restructure with no behaviour change |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `test` | Adding or fixing tests |
| `chore` | Build process, tooling, dependency updates |
| `ci` | CI/CD configuration changes |

**Examples:**

```bash
feat(engine): support for Promise.allSettled simulation
fix(callstack): prevent duplicate frame IDs on fast step navigation
docs(architecture): add WASM boundary section to mermaid diagram
chore(deps): upgrade gsap to 3.12.5
```

---

## Pull Request Process

1. **Sync with upstream** before pushing:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Keep PRs focused.** One concern per PR. A PR that fixes a bug and adds a feature will be asked to split.

3. **Fill in the PR template** completely — description, motivation, screenshots for UI changes, and steps to test.

4. **Ensure the build passes:**
   ```bash
   pnpm run build
   pnpm tsc --noEmit
   ```

5. **Self-review your diff** before requesting review. Remove debug logs, commented-out code, and unrelated changes.

6. **Request review** from `@GourangDasSamrat` or leave it open — the maintainer triages open PRs weekly.

7. **Address review comments** with new commits (do not force-push during review). Once approved, the maintainer will squash-merge.

### PR Checklist

```
- [ ] Branched from latest main
- [ ] Commit messages follow Conventional Commits
- [ ] `pnpm run build` passes with zero errors
- [ ] `pnpm tsc --noEmit` passes with zero errors
- [ ] No inline CSS added (Tailwind classes only)
- [ ] No eval() or dynamic code execution introduced in the engine
- [ ] New components have proper TypeScript types (no `any`)
- [ ] GSAP animations use refs, not class selectors
- [ ] Screenshots or screen recording attached (for UI changes)
```

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- **Strict mode is on.** `any` is not allowed. Use `unknown` and narrow it.
- Export types and interfaces from `src/types/execution.ts` — do not declare them inline in components.
- Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes.
- All component props must have an explicit interface.

### React

- Functional components only — no class components.
- Use `useCallback` for stable event handler references passed to child components.
- Keep components small and single-purpose. If a component exceeds ~150 lines, consider splitting.
- Avoid `useEffect` for derived state — compute it inline or use Zustand selectors.

### Styling

- **Tailwind CSS utility classes only.** No inline `style={{}}` props.
- If a style truly cannot be expressed in Tailwind, add it to `src/styles/globals.css` with a comment explaining why.
- Dark theme is the only supported theme — do not add `light:` variants without a feature discussion first.

### Animations

- All GSAP targets must be captured via `useRef` — never use class or ID selectors.
- Diff previous vs current entries in `useEffect` and animate only changed elements.
- Prefer `gsap.fromTo` over `gsap.to` for entrance animations so the start state is explicit.
- Clean up GSAP timelines on component unmount: `return () => tl.kill()`.

## Testing

The project currently relies on TypeScript's type system and manual browser testing. Automated tests are a welcome contribution.

If you add tests, place them in `src/__tests__/` and follow the naming convention `ComponentName.test.tsx` or `engineName.test.ts`.

To run a type-check as a smoke test:

```bash
pnpm tsc --noEmit
pnpm run build
```

---

## Adding a New Visualization Panel

1. Create `src/components/Visualizer/YourPanel.tsx`.
2. Define the props interface using types from `src/types/execution.ts` — or add new types there.
3. Add the relevant data to `ExecutionStep` in `src/types/execution.ts`.
4. Update `ExecutionEngine.ts` to populate the new field in each snapshot.
5. Update `executionStore.ts` if new state is needed.
6. Mount the panel inside `src/components/Layout/AppLayout.tsx`.
7. Add GSAP entrance/exit animations using the `useRef` + `useEffect` diff pattern.
8. Update [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) — component tree and folder structure sections.

---

## Improving the Execution Engine

The engine (`src/engine/ExecutionEngine.ts`) currently uses line-by-line pattern matching. Improvements are very welcome.

**Principles to preserve:**

- The public interface `analyze(code: string): ExecutionStep[]` must not change signature.
- Output must be deterministic — same input always produces same steps.
- `eval()` and `new Function()` must never be used — this is a security requirement.
- Each step must be a complete, immutable snapshot (no shared mutable references).

**Good areas for improvement:**

- Detecting `for...of`, `for...in`, array methods with callbacks
- Accurate generator function simulation
- Better `async/await` chain tracing
- Structured clone of snapshot data to prevent reference sharing bugs
